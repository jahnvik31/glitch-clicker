# The Glitch Clicker

A Python-based incremental clicker game built with Tkinter. 

I created this project as a personal refresher to polish my Python skills after a two-year hiatus. It focuses on re-learning object-oriented programming patterns and GUI development.

## Project Goals
- **Refactoring Skills:** Implementing clean class structures instead of global scripts.
- **State Management:** Handling dynamic game states (the "glitch" mechanic).
- **File I/O:** implementing local data persistence for high scores.

## Features
- **Dynamic Scaling:** Click value doubles after a threshold (10 clicks).
- **Persistence:** High Score is automatically saved locally.
- **Economy:** Currency exchange mechanism implemented for risk/reward logic.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
